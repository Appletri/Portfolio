      <p>In 2021, I embarked on my coding and web development journey, delving into self-learning through <strong>the Odin Project</strong>. After a few months of dedicated effort, my team and I participated in The Odin Project's inaugural <strong>game jam</strong>, clinching <strong>second place</strong> despite our limited experience. This achievement reinforced my belief in our capabilities, underscoring the importance of meticulous planning and execution.</p>
      
      <p>Since then, my commitment to coding has only deepened. While balancing my full-time job, I've been honing my coding skills relentlessly. I am well aware of the challenges faced by new software engineers in today's competitive market. However, this daunting reality has not deterred me; instead, it fuels my determination to keep practicing and improving my abilities.</p>
